The differences between these 3 motions are as such: 
- The first motion eases into the motion and progressively speeds up.
- The second motion eases into the motion and progressively speeds up initially, but towards the tail end of the motion, the speed begins to plateau and halt.
- The third motion maintains a consistent speed and accelerates from start to the end of the motion.
For some reason, the first and second motion would not play out however the third motion would, but I had guessed what would occur based on prior knowledge.

When each motion has a frame overlap, they begin to smoothly transition into one another, easing into motion they're supposed to act out next. As you can see, the first Up&Down motion begins to spin right before the motion ends, and transitions into the Rotate animation. The transition isnt as noticeable between Rotate and Left&Right since it occurs so late into the second motion, but there is still an overlap transition occuring.

LAB01-PART-02-Analysis

The clip that I'm breaking down is the Monster's Inc. intro, where Luxo Jr. tilts his head upward towards the viewer from the ground. The total animation takes 3 seconds, or 72 frames. About halfway into the animation, Luxo Jr. moves his head up towards the viewer, and once he is facing the viewer, he holds that position until the screen fades. Luxo Jr. somewhat eases in and out of the motion, but the motion itself is abrupt. The stationary objects in this clip are the letters P, X, A, and R. The only dynamic object in this clip is Luxo Jr.

As you can see from the video, the letter P, X, A, and R are substituted for black diamonds, whereas Luxo Jr. is now a star. Looking at them next to one another, they seem quite similar in the actual motion that is taking place. The differences I can see however is the lighting being different between my rendition and the Monster's Inc. intro because Luxo Jr. himself is the source of light. When I tried tieing the light source to the star in my version, it didn't really give off the same vibe as the Monster's Inc. intro because the background was different and the light interacted with the environment much differently. It also wasn't coming directly from a point on the star, but rather the light source was just mimmicking the star's movements from slightly above the star because I couldn't find a way to completely attach the light source to the star itself.
